      "(Reuters) - Robinhood Markets Inc's user agreement is likely to protect the brokerage app from a barrage of lawsuits filed by customers after it blocked a frenzied trading rally in companies such as GameStop Corp that was fueled on social media forums.\n",

      "I think the loss of RH BUYERS also effects the price of everyone else who bought those securities. They lost because of the added upward pressure the RH Buyers would have added; so not only RH INVESTORS  lost out. Ironically,  by not being allowed to buy RH BUYERS were shielded from  the loss others incurred. But it‚Äôs subjective because their added pressure might have been the added force NEEDED to break the Short Goons from the beat they created. But I think their is also a coordinated conspiracy that was carelessly planned in desperation by these investment institutions that in their panic and their careless disregard breaches many SEC covenants such as good faith protection of their clients , restricting margin buys while they as adversary in one case shorted  140% of the outstanding float, and used their back door buying and selling in an organized manner that breaches their independence - all of which means they ganged up in Bad Faith.\n",

Right now $550 investment and from what I understand... now I'm stupid at all this compared to you all... but they have it where after they meet their goal they will do a 11:1 split. So start off with 550 shares and it goes like gme is.... that's still a mighty fine turn around for almost everyone. Even at 340 a share that's a $187,000 from a $550 dollar investment. What you all think? Or where in the ever loving heck do I go to get on board!?!?!?!? 4 kids.... I'd like that bread too. 20 year long career, in my late 30's, fell over and died in 2019 right in front of my wife and kids(I have addison's disease, Churgs strouse, bronchial stasis, and a rare asthma, add in a horrid resp infection and I croaked over in my living room). I'm so ready to bank somehow and be able to focus on my health all the while having financial abilities I've never had for my family. I don't want to go out croaking again before then. In this dad's eyes, I've just got to accomplish this. I have no idea how nor do ik how long I'll be here on this earth but I doubt I'll be an old man at this point and opinion on my life. Just blows.

I remember once I took a group of people at the Children‚Äôs hospital and they left some financial documents in the car but I also remember their discussions. They were talking about the finances of Children‚Äôs hospital and that they had so much money it was unbelievable to them. They were talking about how well run the company was and they had a lot of money that needed to be invested.

      "Representation of this story as a redistribution of wealth in society is appealing but wrong. Gamestop is owned by Blackrock, Vanguard, Fidelity, Susquehanna, State Street, Dimension Fund, etc. who are far wealthier than the hedge funds. They, like Keith Gill, bought in low so they are sitting on huge profits. Their profits are coming from hedge fund losses and 000's of retail investors who bought in too high. The only redistribution that has occurred has been from the wealthy to the wealthier and a few retail investors. When Keith Gill sells the price will drop off a cliff so fast that you will not be able to react to the speed of your losses. If you dont believe me then why dont you ask Keith to share his pricing strategy with you. I challenge him to do it in order to put you his followers in an informed financial position.\n",

They lost the other day and for once, you couldn't stop and just let the system do what it does.  Its ok they can short GME but heaven for bid no one can buy it. THINK ABOUT THAT FOR ONE SECOND.  THAT IS NOT THE FREE WORLD OF TRADING. I CAN TELL YOU THERE ARE THOUSANDS THAT ARE PONYING UP THEIR LAWYERS.  I'll have close out my account due to this unethical \"business\" strategy.  I thought for once, this could be a place to trade at will - free from fees - boy was I wrong.  I do  NOT need a FKN mom telling me \"Oh Johnny, only one apple at a time!\" That is flipping ridiculous!!!  And to say you have all these \"fiduciary things to comply\" - f that!

You shut it down because you're backed by corrupt Wall Street punks THAT is WHY!!  They cried over a few billion $ lost and spread out however, through all the manipulation of buying and transferring shares sideways to make it look like its falling out (yes we know) that isn't wrong?

      "It‚Äôs amazing the myriad of ways the impact of something so specific as the recent run up in stonks üöÄ like GME and others can  have on society. I continue to be surprised day after day by the insurmountable beauty and simplicity of the human spirit. Today, for so many of us, we face the most difficult and trying season of our lives. As violence, censorship, and government corruption proliferate the globe, hatred and distrust for our fellow man continue to escalate. However, in the midst of everything going on since 2020, what started as a little sub here on Reddit (wsb) has not only showed the world what the little man can do when united with purpose, but this growing community (yes I know, and filled with all sorts of kinds of people#LOL) is proof that not all is lost! Wether you came here out of curiosity or to make money or to learn how to invest, it is of paramount importance to remember the power of community. We all have something to offer ‚Äúthe pack‚Äù. Reading through various posts the last couple weeks and watching so many awesome videos‚ÄîI am in awe again. As easy as it is sometimes to just hate people or write them off over certain differences, the kind of comradery taking place here lately reminds me that even though we can be miles apart, gay, undecided, black, white  or purple, nothing is impossible when we put aside our differences and work together for a greater purpose. We are the little guys‚Äîthe underdogs‚Äîa nation of mutants to our era. FUCK MR. GLOBAL LETS ALL KEEP ON STICKING IT TO THE MAN!!!\n",

      "\n",
      "Abusive shorting are not random acts of a renegade hedge funds, but rather a coordinated business plan that is carried out by a collusive consortium of hedge funds and prime brokers, with help from their friends at the DTC and major clearinghouses. Potential target companies are identified, analyzed and prioritized. The attack is planned to its most minute detail.\n",
      "\n",
      "The plan consists of taking a large short position, then crushing the stock price, and, if possible, putting the company into bankruptcy. Bankrupting the company is a short homerun because they never have to buy real shares to cover and they don't pay taxes on the ill-gotten gain.\n",
      "\n",
      "When it is time to drive the stock price down, a blitzkrieg is unleashed against the company by a cabal of short hedge funds and prime brokers. The playbook is very similar from attack to attack, and the participating prime brokers and lead shorts are fairly consistent as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Typical tactics include the following:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Flooding the offer side of the board - Ultimately the price of a stock is found at the balance point where supply (offer) and demand (bid) for the shares find equilibrium. This equation happens every day for every stock traded. On days when more people want to buy than want to sell, the price goes up, and, conversely, when shares offered for sale exceed the demand, the price goes down.\n",
      "\n",
      "The shorts manipulate the laws of supply and demand by flooding the offer side with counterfeit shares. They will do what has been called a short down ladder. It works as follows: Short A will sell a counterfeit share at $10. Short B will purchase that counterfeit share covering a previously open position. Short B will then offer a short (counterfeit) share at $9. Short A will hit that offer, or short B will come down and hit Short A's $9 bid. Short A buys the share for $9, covering his open $10 short and booking a $1 profit.\n",
      "\n",
      "By repeating this process the shorts can put the stock price in a downward spiral. If there happens to be significant long buying, then the shorts draw from their reserve of \"strategic fails-to-deliver\" and flood the market with an avalanche of counterfeit shares that overwhelm the buy side demand. Attack days routinely see eighty percent or more of the shares offered for sale as counterfeit. Company news days are frequently attack days since the news will \"mask\" the extraordinary high volume. It doesn't matter whether it is good news or bad news.\n",
      "\n",
      "Flooding the market with shares requires foot soldiers to swamp the market with counterfeit shares. An off-shore hedge fund devised a remarkably effective incentive program to motivate the traders at certain broker dealers. Each trader was given a debit card to a bank account that only he could access. The trader's performance was tallied, and, based upon the number of shares moved and the other \"success\" parameters; the hedge fund would wire money into the bank account daily. At the end of each day, the traders went to an ATM and drew out their bribe. Instant gratification.\n",
      "\n",
      "Global Links Corporation is an example of how wholesale counterfeiting of shares will decimate a company's stock price. Global Links is a company that provides computer services to the real estate industry. By early 2005, their stock price had dropped to a fraction of a cent. At that point, an investor, Robert Simpson, purchased 100%+ of Global Links' 1,158,064 issued and outstanding shares. He immediately took delivery of his shares and filed the appropriate forms with the SEC, disclosing he owned all of the company's stock. His total investment was $5205. The share price was $.00434. The day after he acquired all of the company's shares, the volume on the over-the-counter market was 37 million shares. The following day saw 22 million shares change hands - all without Simpson trading a single share. It is possible that the SEC has been conducting a secret investigation, but that would be difficult without the company's involvement. It is more likely the SEC has not done anything about this fraud.\n",
      "\n",
      "Massive counterfeiting can drive the stock price down in a matter of hours on extremely high volume. This is called \"crashing\" the stock and a successful \"crash\" is a one-day drop of twenty-percent or a thirty-five percent drop in a week. In order to make the crash \"stick\" or make it more effective, it is done concurrently with all or most of the following:\n",

The common thread: A number of the \"friendly\" reporters worked for The Street.com, an Internet advisory service that short hedge-fund managers David Rocker and Jim Cramer owned. This alumni association supported the short attack by producing slanted, libelous, innuendo laden stories that disparaged the company, as it was being crashed.\n",

      "Jim Cramer, in a video-taped interview with The Street.com, best described the media function:\n",
      "\n",
      ">When (shorting) ... The hedge fund mode is to not do anything remotely truthful, because the truth is so against your view, (so the hedge funds) create a new 'truth' that is development of the fiction... you hit the brokerage houses with a series of orders (a short down ladder that pushes the price down), then we go to the press. You have a vicious cycle down - it's a pretty good game.\n",

      "\n",
      "First, we need to understand what is \"Days to Cover\" or \"Short Ratio\" .\n",
      "\n",
      "Official definition:\n",
      "\n",
      "‚Ä¢ ‚Å†Days to cover, also called short ratio, measures the expected number of days to close out a company's issued shares that have been shorted. ‚Ä¢ ‚Å†Days to cover is calculated by taking the number of currently shorted shares and dividing that amount by the average daily trading volume for the company in question. ‚Ä¢ ‚Å†A high 'days to cover' ratio can often signal a potential short squeeze.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dumbed down version:\n",
      "\n",
      "* imagine you're Melvin Capital and you have 1 million dildos up your ass. How long will it take to get all those dildos out of your ass? If the volume of dildo removing is 1 per day, then it'll take 1 million days to remove 1 million dildos up your ass. If it's 50,000 dildos a day, then it's 20 days.\n",
      "* Same thing with covering short positions. How long will it take Melvin Capital and other shorters to cover their short positions? You take alllll the shorted shares, divided by the average volume of share movement per day, and you get something called \"Days to Cover\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Now you know what day's to cover means, you can check many websites to see what is the days to cover for GME.\n",
      "\n",
      "So you can see, even if Melvin Capital wants to cover their shorts, it's gonna take them DAYS, and right now it's gonna take them an entire trading week to cover their position.\n",
      "\n",
      "So what does that mean for us?\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, we're just waiting for the day when Melvin Capital starts covering their position. When is that day? VERY FUCKING SOON. They're are bleeding out of their ass with the insane interest rate they're paying for their position, and a lot of puts are expiring on Friday, plus a lot of ITM (in the money) calls expire Friday and can be exercised to get shares.\n",
      "\n",
      "Friday might be the day where Melvin Capital have no choice BUT to start covering.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, IF this happens, then it's not gonna take Melvin Capital 1 hour to cover all their shorts, but DAYS. Meaning if Melvin capital starts covering FRIDAY, it will take them at LEAST 5 DAYS to fully cover, which means ALL of next week, the price will keep increasing and increasing!

      "Representation of this story as a redistribution of wealth in society is appealing but wrong. Gamestop is owned by Blackrock, Vanguard, Fidelity, Susquehanna, State Street, Dimension Fund, etc. who are far wealthier than the hedge funds. They, like Keith Gill, bought in low so they are sitting on huge profits. Their profits are coming from hedge fund losses and 000's of retail investors who bought in too high. The only redistribution that has occurred has been from the wealthy to the wealthier and a few retail investors. When Keith Gill sells the price will drop off a cliff so fast that you will not be able to react to the speed of your losses. If you dont believe me then why dont you ask Keith to share his pricing strategy with you. I challenge him to do it in order to put you his followers in an informed financial position.\n",

THAT IS NOT THE FREE WORLD OF TRADING. I CAN TELL YOU THERE ARE THOUSANDS THAT ARE PONYING UP THEIR LAWYERS.  I'll have close out my account due to this unethical \"business\" strategy.  I thought for once, this could be a place to trade at will - free from fees - boy was I wrong.
